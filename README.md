# STM32F4xx Drivers
The project is a more or less a colne of STM32 HALL library. 
Main idea is to develop an API that impements all the functionaities which allow to use microcontroller peripherials such as simple GPIO, communication modules (I2C, UART) and others in form of functions that can be called directly in the code without working on single registers. 
The idea is simply to redo already existing solutions such as  Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) and get familiar with operating on low level MCU.
